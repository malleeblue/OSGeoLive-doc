Starting build cycle for OSGeoLive 13 and call for translators and documenters

28 February 2019

Are you interested in joining our Open Source GIS experience? The build cycle for the next OSGeoLive release, 13.0, is going to start in 3 weeks at OSGeo Code Sprint 2019 in Minneapolis-St. Paul [1]. The final version is planned to be ready at 2nd August 2019 in time for FOSS4G 2019 in Bucharest [2]. Have a look at our schedule for the the detailed steps [3].

Till then we have many challenges - from simple to challenging, to help describe and train people in the value of Open Source GIS.
Translation

Are you multi-lingual and interested in Open Source GIS? At the end of 2017 we moved the translation of OSGeoLive to transifex [4] and we still have many open translations. How about help translate one or two of the Project Overviews or Quickstarts? Have a look at our translation guide [5] to get involved.
Packages

Are you a programmer or packager with experience in one of the Open Source GIS applications. Are you interested in helping update a project to the latest version.

Are you a technical writer interested in making FOSS4G accessible to all?

Join us at OSGeo Code Sprint 2019

There will be the OSGeo Code Sprint 2019 in Bucharest from 14th to 17th May 2019 [1]. Some people from OSGeoLive team will be there. We'd love to see you, whether you are new to Open Source or an experienced old timer.
